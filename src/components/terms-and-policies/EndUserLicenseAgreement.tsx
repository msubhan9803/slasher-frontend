        The Application is provided to you “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and with

      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on
        implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory
        rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
        limitations may not apply to you.
      </p>
      <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability
        of Slasher Corp and any of its suppliers under any
        provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the
        foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the
        Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
        Slasher Corp or its suppliers be liable for any
        special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
        (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss
        of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
        injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to
        the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software
        and/or third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in
        connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Slasher Corp
        or any supplier has been advised of the
        possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
        essential purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
        exclusion may not apply to you.

      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or
        invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish
        the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
        applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full
        force and effect.
      </p>
      <h3>Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
        require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not
        effect a party&apos;s ability to exercise such right or require such
        performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach
        constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.
